| **ex01** | `ft_garden_data.py` | Incorporating data structuring within an object to manage a garden's state. |
| **ex02** | `ft_plant_growth.py` | Implementing methods that modify object states over time. |
| **ex03** | `ft_plant_factory.py` | Understanding class-level operations and perhaps simple design patterns like Factory for creating plants. |
| **ex04** | `ft_garden_security.py` | Concepts of data protection, getters, and setters. |
| **ex05** | `ft_plant_types.py` | Introduction to class inheritance and polymorphism showcasing different plant varieties. |
| **ex06** | `ft_garden_analytics.py` | Combining object data to perform calculations and return analytical metrics about the garden instances. |
